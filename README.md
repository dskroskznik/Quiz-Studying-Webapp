This stock market program is all about analyzing stock market data (from a finite data set) over predetermined selections made by the user. The stock market is a collection of exchanges through which equity shares of public companies are issued, bought, and sold [1](#references). The role of the stock market is to provide a way for companies to raise capital by selling ownership shares to public investors. At the same time, the stock market allows private investors to buy shares of stock in public companies and become part owners of their businesses [1](#references). 
The main objective of this program is to thoroughly, accessibly, and informatively demonstrate and represent object-oriented programs, user-to-data interaction, and technical analysis.
