## Overview
```php
Welcome to the QuizStudy website! Uncover and key into various quiz topics to challenge your
 knowledge with, or develop and edit your quizzes on whatever topic you desire.
Please encourage others to test their knowledge on these quizzes by sharing
 and commenting on quizzes about your experience which benefits the creators and multiple other users taking quizzes.
The purpose of QuizStudy is to offer an engaging and interactive platform for
 learning while improving self-assessment.
Whether you are a student preparing for exams, a teacher looking for
 creative ways to test your students, or simply a curious mind wanting to expand your knowledge.
QuizStudy offers a user-friendly environment to quickly suit your academic needs.
This web application constitutes a simplified and sufficient registration system
 for individual users to develop their quizzes and share feedback with other quizzes on their terms.
 furthermore, the web app continuously encourages to treat users with respect
 and maintain cyber etiquette towards others on the website.
The objective of this project is to apply accessibility through a safe
 authentication system, demonstrate CRUD program structures, and display
 user-to-data interaction through returns and retrievals.
